# 🔬Machina-Learning_Recurrent-Neural_Network

## 📖 Overview

This notebook explores the **fundamentals of neural networks**, including their architecture, training methodologies, and optimization techniques. The implementation covers **custom datasets, loss functions, and backpropagation** to build and refine deep learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives

-  Understand the structure of **artificial neural networks (ANNs)**.
-  Implement **fully connected layers** and activation functions.
-  Train a deep neural network using **gradient-based optimization**.
-  Evaluate the model using performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Dependencies & Installation

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## 🔑 Key Components

-  **Confusion Matrix & Precision-Recall** ➝ Assessing model reliability.
-  **Hyperparameter Tuning** ➝ Experimenting with learning rates and batch sizes.

## 📂 Metadata Files

-  **Generated metadata files** store model weights, training logs, and test results.
-  These files help track performance across different runs and aid reproducibility.

## 🏃‍♂️ Execution Steps

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed and properly configured.
2.  Run all cells sequentially to build, train, and evaluate the neural network.
3.  Analyze loss curves and classification metrics to refine model performance.
4.  Use stored metadata files for future experiments and comparisons.

## ⚠️ Notes

- 🛠️ **PyTorch-based Implementation** ➝ TensorFlow is not used in this notebook.
- 🚨 **Ensure all cells are executed before submission** to maintain consistency.
- 🎯 Deep networks require careful tuning of hyperparameters to generalize well.
